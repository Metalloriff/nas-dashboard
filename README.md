# Description
This is a simple, modular server dashboard I made for my NAS. You can add as many as you'd like in the "modules" folder, along with server-side API for them.

**Please note that this is a personal project, and may not be production-ready. If you run into issues, feel free to drop an issue on this repo.**

# Installing
Note: This is my first dockerfile of my own, so it's likely not perfect.

First start by either cloning the entire repo, or just downloading the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files. They're all that's necessary for setup.

Then run `docker compose up --build`
